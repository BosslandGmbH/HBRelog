[font=Segoe UI][size=3]Hello Buddies,
Every true developer has his own vision on how things should look like. So I've decided from the permission of Highvoltz to provide support for my own github branch of the well known HBRelog utility.[/size]

[size=4][i][b]For administration / moderators[/b][/i][/size]
[size=3]I've searched any possible sources about the rules of this forum and did not find the reason it could violate any. If you find some please contact me ASAP. Also I've created the [URL="https://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/community-developer-forum/222189-legal-distributing-hbrelog-utility.html"]forum thread[/URL] about the latter form of distribution, but it didn't get aswered.[/size]

[size=4][i][b]What you can get from it?[/b][/i][/size]
[size=3]Right now I'm [b]very[/b] motivated to keep implementing new features and tune UI, so you can get free support here, get issues fixed in a near-week-time frame, discuss your ideas or what you wanna see in the change log.[/size]
